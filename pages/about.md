It’s easy to take the internet for granted, but more than a million people in Scotland lack the [basic online skills](http://www.go-on.co.uk/opportunity/basic-online-skills/) to communicate, find information, get things done and stay safe on the web. What's more, many charities and voluntary organisations are missing a huge opportunity to boost their impact and engagement by using digital tools.

We’re part of the [Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations](http://www.scvo.org.uk), and are working with partners across the country to promote digital participation.

The programme is overseen by a leadership group drawn from across the public, private and third sectors. The group's [terms of reference](/about/leadership-group-tor/) set out its role and remit in more detail.

Our work on digital participation is generously funded by the [Scottish Government](http://www.scotland.gov.uk) and closely linked to the wider [Digital Scotland](http://www.digitalscotland.org/") agenda.
