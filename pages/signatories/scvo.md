We are the membership organisation for Scotland's charities, voluntary and community groups and social enterprises. We were an early signatory to the [Digital Participation Charter](/charter/) and in late 2013 we agreed, in partnership with the [Scottish Government](/charter/scottish-government), to spearhead a renewed effort on digital participation in Scotland.

You can find out lots more about our digital participation programme on this website. We will be getting directly involved in some projects as well, so watch this space for updates.
