We are the membership organisation for Scotland's charities, voluntary and community groups and social enterprises. We were an early signatory to the [Digital Participation Charter](/charter/) and in late 2013 [we launched a new digital participation programme](http://www.scvo.org.uk/media-release/charities-to-help-get-vulnerable-people-online/) to drive this agenda forward.

You can find out [lots more about our digital participation programme](/about/) on this website. We will be getting directly involved in some practical projects as well, so watch this space for updates.
