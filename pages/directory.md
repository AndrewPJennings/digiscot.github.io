title: Let's Get On directory
excerpt: For many people who want to learn how to do things online, taking the first step is easier if there's someone else around to lend a helping hand.

We know it's not always easy to find this sort of help, so we're building a directory of places in Scotland where it's on offer. This includes places like libraries and computer clubs, and everything from formal courses to informal drop-in sessions.

Now I'll find out about the hashtag problem

### Search the directory

To see what's listed in your area, start by entering a postcode.

<form class="form-inline form-front" role="form" action="http://letsgeton.digitalscotland.org/Search" method="GET">
  <input type="text" class="form-control input-lg" id="postcode" name="geo.postcode" placeholder="Enter postcode">
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Search</button>
</form>

For people who aren't able to search online, the same information is available from a freephone helpline: 0800 771234.

### Get a free listing

We want the directory to be as useful as possible for as many people as possible, so the more places we have listed the better.

If your organisation helps people to learn then we would love to add you to the directory. A listing in the directory is free, all we need is a little bit of information about where you are and what you do, to make it easier for people to find you when they do a search.

### Learn My Way

We've partnered with [Tinder Foundation](http://www.tinderfoundation.org) to develop extra learning resources for people and organisations in Scotland. [Learn My Way](http://scotland.learnmyway.com) is a free online resource designed to help people learn basic online skills. If your organisation helps people to learn then you can apply for a free centre code, for your learners to use when they register on the Learn My Way website. This will help you to keep count of all your learners and see how they are getting on.
