Milo is the database and interaction management system for the third sector interface (TSI) network in Scotland. Milo is managed by SCVO, and was designed and implemented by Sopra Group. TSIs have been using the system to manage their interactions with voluntary organisations and volunteers since 2012.

The Milo platform is currently undergoing a full system rebuild on the Salesforce platform. TSIs are expected to migrate to the new platform in May and June of 2015, before support for the existing system ceases on 30th June 2015.

This FAQ is the online resource for your questions about Milo. If you don’t find what you’re looking for here, drop us an email and we’ll make sure we address your query. 

## Why is Milo moving to a new system?

The current Milo system is supported by Sopra Group and hosted at Pulsant, however ongoing support costs are unsustainable in the light of cuts to Scottish Government funding. In addition to this, the bespoke build of the system means development and bug fixes are prohibitively expensive. Therefore a full system rebuild will be undertaken by Synovations to implement Milo on the Salesforce platform.
