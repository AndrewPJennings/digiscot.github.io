**OVERVIEW**

The Challenge Fund is a fund of £200,000 (per annum) aimed at groups and organisations that work closely with local communities. The fund is to enable them to improve digital skills, digitise content and build digital networks in order that all individuals across Scotland are able to thrive in the digital world.

A total of 25 awards to the total value of over £100k were made in Call 1 (December 2014). A total of 71 applications were received during this first round, applying for more than £600,000. A list of successful applicants can be found at http://digital.scvo.org.uk/challenge/. 

The focus of the fund is on smaller scale awards to support activity that will generate valuable learning for future activity or demonstrate replicable and scalable activities.  

It is anticipated that awards will range from £200 to £10,000. Our average award in Call 1 was £6019.52. All awards require to be fully costed with details of all budget items.  

We recognise that you may have additional funding sources identified or secured for your proposed project and details of these should be included within your application. 

In partnership with the Digital Participation Charter signatories http://digital.scvo.org.uk/charter/, a wide range of support types are being developed, e.g. provision of IT equipment, infrastructure support, provision of volunteers, etc. This will be offered in addition to or as an alternative to a financial grant where appropriate.
