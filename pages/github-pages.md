If your organisation has received support from our [challenge fund](/challenge/) or signed our [digital participation charter](/charter/) then you will have a page on this website where you can share a bit more about who you are and what you are doing. Here is a step-by-step guide to adding content and editing your page.

### Before you start

Our website is powered by a service called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so if you do not already have a GitHub account then you will need to create one:

* [Click here to create a new GitHub account](https://github.com/join)

Creating an account is free and you only need to do this step once.

### Updating a page

Follow these steps to send us an update:

1. Find the page you want to edit
2. Click the "Update this page" button (it'll be near the bottom of the page)
3. Make your changes in the box marked "Edit file"
4. Click the "Propose file change" button
5. On the next screen describe the changes you've made, and then click the "Send pull request" button

The last step will notify us that there are changes pending, and from here it's our job to review and then publish your updated page.

### Tips for editing your page

When you're in GitHub, the editable version of your page looks a lot like a plain text file.

#### Front matter

The top part of the file, sandwiched between two sets of `---` marks, is known as the **front matter** (or *metadata*). We use the information here to help build the page and give it the correct address on the internet. **You should avoid editing this section unless you are sure you know what you are doing!**

#### Content

Immediately after the front matter is the **content** of the page itself.

Here are some useful tips for editing the content:

* You don't need to worry about fonts or colours, these will get set automatically
* Remember to leave a blank line between paragraphs
* You can use [Markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) for things like headings and links
* You can also use HTML if you wish, e.g. if you have been given some code to embed a video or tweet
