There are digital participation projects and activities across Scotland in need of help and support. This page lists all the different asks that we know about, so that signatories to our [Digital Participation Charter](/charter/) can see what is required and make contact with the projects and activities they are able to help. If you have a specific ask that you would like to list here then please [contact the team](/contact/).

You can also see a [list of offers from charter signatories](/charter/offers/).
