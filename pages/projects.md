We're supporting a wide range of digital participation projects in communities across Scotland. Many of these have benefited from financial support from our [challenge fund](/resources/challenge-fund/), whilst others have received in-kind support from organisations that have signed our [digital participation charter](/charter/).

As each project gets underway we'll be setting up a page on this site for them to tell their story. Follow the links below to find out more.
