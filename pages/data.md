Good digital and data skills are essential for all modern organisations, and charities and voluntary organisations are no exception.

As part of the work that SCVO does on behalf of the third sector in Scotland, we provide a data management and reporting platform (known as Milo) that is used by Scotland's [Third Sector Interfaces](http://www.vascotland.org/tsis) to track local organisations and volunteering opportunities.

We are working hard to modernise the platform to better meet the needs of the people that use it, and to help organisations develop the digital and data skills they need to get the most out of the platform. We will post more information here as this work progresses. If you use Milo as part of your job and have thoughts or suggestions for us then please do [get in touch](/contact/).

### Open data

We are starting to make some of the data from the Milo platform available more widely, starting with a simple searchable directory of third sector organisations.

### Milo

Milo is the database and interaction management system for the <a href="http://www.vascotland.org/" target="_blank">**third sector interface (TSI)**</a> network in Scotland. Milo is funded by the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/" target="_blank">**Scottish Government**</a> and managed by <a href="http://www.scvo.org.uk/" target="_blank">**SCVO**</a>. TSIs have been using the system to manage their interactions with voluntary organisations and volunteers since 2012.

Check back here to see the latest news and updates about the Milo system and the current rebuild project.

### Big data and the third sector

We are currently supporting a third sector data programme hosted by the [Scottish Universities Insight Institute](http://www.scottishinsight.ac.uk). This is exploring a range of questions around what data there is about the third sector, how data is used in the third sector, and how capacity to work with data can be developed.
