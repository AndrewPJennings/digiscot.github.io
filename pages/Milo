Milo is the database and interaction management system for the <a href="http://www.vascotland.org/" target="_blank">**third sector interface (TSI)**</a> network in Scotland. Milo is funded by the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/" target="_blank">**Scottish Government**</a> and managed by <a href="http://www.scvo.org.uk/" target="_blank">**SCVO**</a>. TSIs have been using the system to manage their interactions with voluntary organisations and volunteers since 2012.
